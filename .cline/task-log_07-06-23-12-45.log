GOAL: Create a product description processing module that loads the CSV file 'Product_Query_2025_06_06.csv', merges ProductDescription and ProductDescription2 columns, renames BrandDescription to BrandName, and preserves ProductCategory column exactly as-is.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Created a highly optimized ProductTransformer class in product_transformer.py with O(n) processing methods:
   - Used vectorized pandas operations for merging descriptions
   - Implemented conditional logic with numpy.where for performance
   - Added robust error handling for missing columns or data issues
   - Created clean interface for renaming columns with validation
   - Ensured specified columns are preserved exactly as required

2. Integrated the transformer into the pipeline:
   - Added command-line flag --process-product-query for explicit control
   - Implemented process_product_query() function in run_pipeline.py
   - Ensured processed data is saved in both CSV and Parquet formats
   - Preserved required columns unchanged while standardizing others
   - Added detailed logging and error handling

3. Used optimal data processing techniques:
   - Minimized memory usage with efficient pandas operations
   - Used string methods for text processing instead of loops
   - Implemented early validation to fail fast on missing data
   - Created reusable components with single responsibility
   - Followed PEP 8 style guidelines and meaningful naming
