Ok I need to make the following changes to this code to help improve the ouptuts: 

1) for Candian products, the grades should be AAA, AA, or A 
2) We added a new grade called: Hereford

Both of those should be added to the beef_cuts excel and automatically included in the options (please confirm this)

What I need you to do is to update the prompt (the dynamic prompt) to ensure that these changes are included
