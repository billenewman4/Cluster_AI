GOAL: Extend the beef chuck extraction pipeline to handle all primal beef cuts from the beef_cuts.xlsx spreadsheet dynamically.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Created ReferenceDataLoader class to dynamically load and parse the beef_cuts.xlsx spreadsheet
- Implemented DynamicPromptGenerator to generate specialized prompts for each primal cut
- Developed DynamicBeefExtractor to handle any primal cut with dynamic prompting
- Updated ExtractionController to support both original chuck extractor and new dynamic extractor
- Documented architecture decisions and implementation details in instructions.md
- Designed solution for automatic synchronization with spreadsheet changes at runtime
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing beef chuck extraction processes
