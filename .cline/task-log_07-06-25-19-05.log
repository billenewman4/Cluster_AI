GOAL: Fix category mapping in product processing to correctly handle ProductCategory values in a case-insensitive manner.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Optimized the ProductTransformer class with robust case-insensitive column handling:
   - Created O(1) lookup dictionary with lowercase keys for case-insensitive column access
   - Implemented optimized column mapping that works regardless of column name casing
   - Used next() with generator expressions for efficient column name matching
   - Added detailed logging of column mapping actions for better troubleshooting
   - Ensured product_code columns are consistently cast to string type for reliable merging

2. Fixed specific category mapping issues:
   - Fixed the critical issue where ProductCategory values were not being properly mapped to category_description
   - Implemented complete case-insensitive mappings for all standard column names
   - Preserved column data integrity while standardizing names for pipeline compatibility
   - Added type checking and conversion for numeric product codes
   - Enhanced logging to show category counts for validation

3. Optimized for performance and maintainability:
   - Used efficient dictionary lookups instead of string comparisons for O(1) access
   - Implemented vectorized operations for all data transformations
   - Followed Python best practices with meaningful variable names and comments
   - Added complete error handling for robust operation
