GOAL: Optimize product description processing integration with improved pipeline flow

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Enhanced ProductTransformer with case-insensitive column mapping using O(1) lookup dictionaries
- Made product query processing the default pipeline behavior replacing --process-product-query with --skip-product-query flag
- Fixed pipeline flow to continue to LLM extraction after product processing when needed
- Improved error handling with precise exception messages and proper exit codes
- Added support for multiple column name variations (ProductCategory/productcategory)
- Ensured all data transformations use vectorized pandas operations for O(n) performance
