GOAL: Optimize product category handling in the extraction pipeline and improve extractor architecture

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Fixed product category handling by implementing proper pipeline integration with both traditional BeefChuckExtractor and advanced DynamicBeefExtractor
2. Enhanced the extraction architecture using optimized algorithms:
   - O(1) lookup using dictionary-based extractors mapping
   - Lazy initialization of extractor instances (created only when needed)
   - Case-insensitive category matching for improved robustness
   - Clear separation between beef and non-beef category handling
3. Improved error handling and logging:
   - Comprehensive logging of category support status
   - Graceful fallback to legacy extractors when needed
   - Clear TODO annotations for future pork/chicken extractors
4. Applied code optimization:
   - Eliminated redundant conditional checks
   - Reduced memory usage by reusing extractor instances
   - Improved code structure and readability
   - Added explicit documentation about category limitations

Technical Implementation Details:
- Using O(1) dictionary lookup instead of repeated string comparisons
- Lazily initializing extractors only when needed (vs eager initialization)
- Proper import structure that handles missing modules gracefully
- Clear separation of concerns between different meat category handlers

Performance Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is number of categories (optimal)
- Space Complexity: O(n) for n categories (optimal)
- Import Efficiency: Imports only modules actually needed
- Memory Usage: Reuses extractor instances instead of creating duplicates
