GOAL: Unify and optimize the extractor architecture to work with all beef categories in beef_cuts.xlsx

IMPLEMENTATION: 
Created a unified extractor architecture that consolidates two separate and incompatible extraction systems:
1. Created a single `BaseExtractor` class with optimized O(1) caching and lookups
2. Implemented a unified `BeefExtractor` supporting all primal cuts dynamically from beef_cuts.xlsx
3. Refactored the category handling in run_pipeline.py to use the unified extractor
4. Added intelligent primal cut inference from category names
5. Removed dependency on legacy BeefChuckExtractor while maintaining compatibility with batch processing

Performance optimizations:
- O(1) category -> extractor mapping via dictionary
- O(1) primal cut lookup for all beef categories
- Efficient caching to avoid redundant LLM API calls
- Single extractor instance reused across all beef categories
- Memory-optimized reference data loading

Algorithm complexity: 
- Time complexity: O(1) for extractor lookup, O(1) for primal cut determination
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of unique primal cuts in reference data

This implementation follows the Open/Closed principle, making it easy to extend to other meat categories (pork, chicken) without modifying existing code.
